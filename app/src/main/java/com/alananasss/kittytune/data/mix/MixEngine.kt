/**
 * Builds the mix: reads the listener, asks SoundCloud for candidates, hands the arithmetic to [MixRanking].
 *
 * ## What "a real algo" means here
 *
 * Not one request. A recommendation is a fan-out and a filter, and the shape below is the standard one: profile
 * the listener from their own history, turn that profile into *seeds*, expand each seed through an endpoint that
 * knows about similarity, then score and diversify what comes back (issue #33).
 *
 * The expansion uses three SoundCloud endpoints, each answering a different question, and the mix is better for
 * having all three than it would be with more of any one:
 *
 *  - **`/tracks/{id}/related`** — "what goes with this track". Their own collaborative filtering, and the
 *    strongest signal available, because it is built from what other listeners actually played next.
 *  - **`system-playlists:artist-stations:{id}`** — "an hour of this artist and their neighbours". This is what
 *    answers "in the Yeat style" directly: the station for an artist is not that artist's catalogue, it is the
 *    neighbourhood around them.
 *  - **`/search/tracks` filtered by tag** — "what is good in this genre right now". Weaker per candidate, but it
 *    is the only one that reaches artists the listener has no path to at all, and a mix with no strangers in it
 *    is not a mix.
 *
 * Seeds are drawn from the top of the profile but *sampled* rather than taken in order, so two presses on the
 * same evening give two different mixes.
 *
 * ## Why every step degrades instead of failing
 *
 * A mix is a nicety. If the history is empty, if a request times out, if the token has expired — the answer is a
 * shorter mix or a mix built from fewer seeds, never an error dialog. The only hard failure is having nothing at
 * all to work from, and that is reported as its own state so the button can say "listen to something first"
 * rather than spinning.
